 * what they want (a system prompt, a user prompt, a JSON schema for the reply)
 * and never which server is listening. What differs between the two is wire
 * format only, and that lives here.
 *
 * Both transports always stream. Node's fetch abandons a request after 300s
 * without response headers, and a local server sends none until the whole
 * generation is finished, so a non-streamed call dies at exactly five minutes
 * on any batch worth sending. That cost a benchmark run to learn. Streaming
 * makes the headers arrive at once; the deltas themselves are incidental.
