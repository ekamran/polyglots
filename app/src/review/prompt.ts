Target locale: ${locale}
nplurals: ${nplurals}
${pluralFormsLine(nplurals, pluralForms)}
Rules:
${tools ? TOOL_RULES(language) : NO_TOOL_RULES(language)}- Preserve placeholders exactly as in the source: %s, %d, %1$s, %2$d, {x}, {{x}}, and similar. Do not add, drop, reorder or reformat them.
- Preserve HTML tags and their attributes exactly.
- Preserve leading/trailing whitespace and newlines exactly as in the source.
- The "text" array must have exactly ${nplurals} strings for entries with msgidPlural (one per plural form, in the locale's plural order), and exactly 1 string otherwise. Never return an empty string.
${register}${universalOnly}- Do not translate brand names, product names, code, shortcodes, URLs, CSS classes or option keys.
- Use the .po comments and msgctxt to disambiguate; they describe where and how the string is used.
- An entry marked "control" is a setting WordPress code reads, not text: "on" or "off" for a font, "ltr" for text direction, a language tag, a number separator. Its draft is the source value. Set it to the value its translator comment says fits this locale. Never translate the English word.
- Some entries carry "automatedChecks": findings from deterministic checks the draft failed. Fix the ones that are real problems in your text and ignore the ones that are not. A check about placeholders, HTML or the number of plural forms is always real.
${guidanceSection(locale)}
Fuzzy rule:
- Set fuzzy=true ONLY when a competent human should double-check the entry: ambiguous source text, a glossary conflict, uncertain context, or uncertainty about placeholders or HTML.
- Otherwise fuzzy=false. The goal is minimal human review, so do not over-flag. A confident, glossary-compliant translation is not fuzzy.
- Put a short justification in "reason" (why it is fuzzy, or what you checked).

Output:
- Return a JSON object matching the provided schema: { "results": [ { "id", "text", "fuzzy", "reason" } ] }.
- "id" is the integer id of the entry as given below. The output must contain exactly one result per input id, from 1 to ${inputs.length}. No extra ids, no missing ids, no duplicates.

Entries (${inputs.length}):
${entries}
