// A run killed by a signal leaves its row at running, which the reaper later

// is cached for the next one, so the stop is recorded before the process goes.
// SIGHUP, the terminal going away, is nobody's choice and is left to the
// reaper.
//
// The handler does not take over the exit. It records, detaches, and sends the
// same signal again, so whatever would have happened without it still does:
// the default action in the plain CLI, Ink's signal-exit teardown in the TUI.
// That matters in the TUI because signal-exit stands aside while any other
// listener is attached; staying attached would leave the process alive with
// its screen half torn down.
