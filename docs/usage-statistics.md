# Usage statistics

polyglots can share a few anonymous totals, so the website can say how much
it has been used. It is off unless you turn it on.

## What is asked

The last step of the setup wizard asks once: "Share anonymous totals (strings
reviewed, number of projects) to show on the website? You can change this any
time." The default answer is No. Leaving the step with `esc` also counts as
No.

## What is sent

At most once a week, one small JSON payload:

- `installId`: a random id made when you turn this on. It lets a weekly
  resend replace last week's numbers instead of adding to them. It is not
  derived from anything about you or your machine.
- `version`: the polyglots version.
- `reviewed`, `drafted`, `repaired`: all-time counts of strings reviewed,
  machine-drafted and repaired by finished runs.
- `projects`: how many different projects those runs covered. A number only.
- `findings`: how often each built-in check fired, for example
  `{"glossary": 12, "placeholder": 3}`. Only the fixed list of check names
  polyglots ships; custom rules are never named.

Never sent: your locale, project names or slugs, file names, source strings,
translations, your WordPress.org username, the review provider or the model.

To see exactly what the next send would contain:

```
polyglots usage-stats show
```

The interactive app shows the same preview under **Configuration › Usage
statistics**.

## How it is sent

In the background when a command starts (`review`, `translate`, `fetch`,
`stats`, or the interactive app), with a five-second timeout. It never delays
or slows a command: if the command finishes first, the send is simply
abandoned. Failures are dropped, nothing is queued, and after a failure it
does not try again for a day.

## What is kept

The endpoint keeps only the latest payload per install id and when it
arrived. It does not store or log IP addresses. The website shows only the
all-time totals across all installs. The endpoint's code is in the polyglots
repository, in [usage-server/](../usage-server/).

## Turning it off

Any of these:

```
polyglots config set usageStats off
```

- In the interactive app: **Configuration › Usage statistics**, then `space`
  or `enter` to toggle.
- Set `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` in your environment. It turns sending off whatever the
  setting says.

Turning it off stops sending; the last totals already sent stay counted.
`polyglots usage-stats reset` forgets the install id; if the setting is on, a
new id is made at the next send. The server cannot link the old id to the new
one, so your earlier totals stay counted under the old id.

Your install id and when it last sent are kept in `usage.json` in the
polyglots data directory (`~/.local/share/polyglots/` by default). It is
created only when the setting is on.

## Turning it on

```
polyglots config set usageStats on
```
