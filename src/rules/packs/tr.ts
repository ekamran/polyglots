// month names, and the names of languages and peoples. Turkish keeps day and
// month names lowercase in generic use (okullar eylülde açılır) and capitalizes
// them only in a specific date, a distinction no pattern can make, so listing
// them trades the ability to flag a wrongly capitalized generic one for not
// flagging every legitimate date.

const CAPITALIZATION = `- {language} does NOT use English Title Case. Only the first word and proper nouns are capitalized. "Tüm Değişiklikleri Kaydet" is wrong; "Tüm değişiklikleri kaydet" is right. Brand names (WordPress, WooCommerce) and acronyms keep their own casing.
- A capital mid-string is legitimate when the word is a proper noun. In {language} that includes place and person names, names of languages and peoples, day and month names inside a specific date, titles of works, and institution names, where every word is capitalized (Türk Dil Kurumu). An automated check cannot recognize most of these, so when a title-case finding is really one of them, clear it.
- Menu labels, screen and section names, and section headings in help or documentation pages are a deliberate exception. TDK madde D capitalizes the words of sign-like labels, and the locale team does not reject a submission over capitalization in those places, so do NOT report title-case for them. This exception covers labels and headings only. Commands, buttons, confirmations, error messages and running prose keep sentence case, and an English calque there is still a problem worth reporting.
- The two kinds of title-case check are not equal evidence. A finding that says the translation "mirrors the English source" means the source itself was Title Case and the translation copied its shape word for word; that is close to proof of an English calque. A finding that only says a word is capitalized mid-string is much weaker: measured against approved WordPress {language} translations it is roughly four times as likely to be a false alarm, and the usual reason is that the capitalized words name a thing, most often a feature, widget, block or key ("Etiket Bulutu bileşeninde", "Hızlı Düzenleme'de göster", "Site Logosu bloğu", "Shift + Ok tuşları"). Check what the capitalized words refer to before confirming that kind.
