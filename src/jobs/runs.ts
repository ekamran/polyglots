// The first three mirror RunState in run-control.ts exactly, so the pause key
// needs no new vocabulary. `done` is the terminal state RunState has no need to
// name, because a finished run has no control left to exercise. `stopped` is
// also terminal, unlike `stopping`, which is a control state a run passes
// through on its way to either `stopped` or `done`.
// What a run row can actually say. `running` is set at the start, `done` by
// finishRun with its frozen totals, `stopped` by abandonRun with none.
//
// This deliberately does NOT mirror `RunState` in run-control.ts. That one is
// in-memory control state for the pause key, and nothing writes `paused` or
// `stopping` to this table — a row saying so would be a state the code cannot
// produce, which is worse than a missing one because it invites a reader to
// handle a case that never arrives. If a later feature genuinely persists a
// paused run, adding the member back is one word.

/**
 * How a run that did not finish came to an end.
 *
 * `state` alone cannot say. It records only that a run is terminal, so a
 * deliberate stop, a thrown error and a killed process all read as `stopped`,
 * and anything counting "did not finish" counts all three as faults. Stopping
 * part way to look at the output and resuming later is ordinary use of this
 * tool, and its work is cached, so filing it beside a crash reports a workflow
 * as a problem.
 *
 * - `stopped`   the operator ended it; the work so far is cached and resumable
 * - `failed`    it threw; the run did not decide how much it got through
 * - `abandoned` the process died and `reapAbandonedRuns` cleared the row later

 *
 * Errs towards leaving rows behind. A pid the operating system has since
 * recycled reads as alive and is skipped, so an abandoned row can survive a
 * pass; it is reaped the next time that pid is free. Leaving a dead row costs
 * a wrong number in `stats`. Stopping a live run costs the run.
